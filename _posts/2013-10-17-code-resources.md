title: Coding Resources

#{{ page.title }}

So now, it seems that my biggest questions of late have revolved around "What are the best resources available to help me learn to code?"

And of course, the internet's just chock full of options out there, so I've decided to compile my own personal list.  As I learn I'll keep it updated based on what I did or did not get out of a particular resource.  For now it's a list of bookmarks for myself, but as time goes on, I hope to turn it into a qualified resource.

More than strictly functional learning, i.e. do whatever it takes to get something up and running, I'm particularly interested in what it takes to code elegantly…In my time as a cook, your efficiency and elegance had much to do with who you learned from as it did your own motivation and effort.  I wonder if code works similarly.  Can I really teach myself what I need to know and who can I pair up with?

###Practical Learning:
* **[Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly) - There are quite a few screencasts and interactive toutorials out there, but this has been the one I've glommed onto the quickest.  Really puts HTML and CSS into practice.  Great as an absolute beginner.  Makes me want to dig further into General Assembly.
* **[Railsbridge](http://railsbridge.org) - Helped a great deal in terms of getting a "setup", namely the basic resources you need to start building.
* **[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)- Where google leads whenever I have a specific code question.
* **[Quora](http://www.quora.com/)- like Stack Overflow but more general.
* **Various Blogs - I'll include a list at some point, but for now, I've yet to filter them effectively.
* [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) - Online learning with specific language tracks
* [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - Another online school with tracks.
* [Dev Bootcamps](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/What-are-the-best-programming-bootcamps-courses-available-in-the-United-States) - Are they worth it?  I'm still figuring that one out.  And if one is in my future, what do I need to do to be prepared?

####Books & Lectures:
I have yet to read any books or really sit through lectures…a symptom of my impatience, but these are the ones on my radar.  I'll let you know if I do actually dig into them.  I believe these will be more useful when I've got more practical experience.  Then again, maybe I won't touch them at all.

* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [Eloquent Ruby](http://eloquentruby.com/)
* [Stanford CS](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx) - Intro to CS courses available online.
* [Academic Earth](http://academicearth.org/courses/data-structures/) - Data Structures course.  I keep reading that Data Structures are fundamental to the understanding of how to code.  Alas, it's a topic that I've yet to broach.

###Specific Tools:
* **[GitHub](http://github.com) - the place to store, control, and make public the stuff I build.  It's so much more than this, but this is how I'm using it for now.
* **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - Great way to blog…what this site runs on.
* **[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - my text editor…totally worth the money.
* **[Mou](http://mouapp.com/) - My Markdown Editor
* **Terminal - Everyone already has it, but we've gotten to know each other so much better lately.
* [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) - Looks like a pretty powerful platform, but in my case, it's also a quick way to get instant feedback without having to repeatedly deploy.
* **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Where to deploy.  This is likely to become more important later.

**Things that have been essential so far.
