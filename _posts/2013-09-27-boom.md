After quite a few fits and starts, we're finally here!

[It's wooorking!](http://youtu.be/0FGh3UOwH8w)

In any case, I've decided that I can no longer wait on the sidelines…I need to build.  I'm slowly starting to learn that starting from scratch is not a big deal…especially when what you've done before serves as an increasingly solid foundation.  Sure, it can still be pretty stressful, but I'm hoping it's the good kind of stress.

In any case here's what I have on slate for now:

* Build an [ice cream magic machine](https://github.com/ajjimenez/ice-cream-magic) as well as a few other things with PNSJI.
* Save all of our [family recipes](http://ajjimenez.github.io/Family-Food-Recipes) for eternity.
* Learn some new languages (Javascript, Ruby…) and use GitHub

Just getting to this point, I've had to learn some new stuff.  And while this is probably so-easy-that-its-rediculous to many here's a quick tab of what I've started to pick up:

* Markdown
* command line-something I really haven't touched all that much since `wolf3d -goobers`
* [Git/GitHub](http://github.com) and the difference between the two
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Rails (at least setting it up and being able to deploy apps via Heroku) thanks [Railsbridge!](http://railsbridge.org)

###…it's about to go down.
