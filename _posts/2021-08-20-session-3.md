#{{ page.title }}

Session 3 definitely took more time to get through. I have a tendency to want to cram every step into one "elegant" line, and I'm finding that it just makes the blockers harder to overcome. Taking things step-by-step definitely helps me get to the solution.

What did I cover today?
- array.each
- bang as modify in place
- times method
- functions
- if else
- breaking things down step by step
