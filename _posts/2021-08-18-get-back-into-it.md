title: Getting back into it

#{{ page.title }}


Wow, it's been a long time, and apparently I haven't learned much, yet have learned so much. Learning to code has been the boogyman in my closet for some time, and while I've skilled up immensely, it's been in almost every area except this fundamental. In light of that, I'm digging in for a bit to try to bring some structure to my learning. I still do whatever it takes to build what I need, but this next phase will definitely be axe sharpening time. In light of that, and to bridge my past self with my current self, here's where my mind is at right now.

### Practical Learning:
#### Things I'm using right now:
- [All aboard boot camp](https://allaboardbootcamp.com) - @seejohnrun created an incredible program for under-represented groups to break into tech and received 381 registrations, 36 of whom graduated the program. I'm fortunate enough to know John through work and he has always been generous with his knowledge and experience. And as far as I can see, his bootcamp is like getting the Avengers of coding together to teach people without any background how to code.
I'm very plainly going to take advantage of this to learn for myself, and perhaps learn from any blockers I encounter by following the curriculum without actually being a part of a class and asking for lots of help. I'm very privileged in that I can ask for lots of help, but I do want to put in as much work as possible so that I can up-level my questions when I do need the help.
-  [freecodecamp.com](https://freecodecamp.com) Still the most recommended free program to learn how to code. I've completed the first two modules of Responsive Web Design last September, so we'll see if it makes sense to pick that path back up as well

#### Stuff to look into:
To keep focus, I'm going to limit what I look at right now to all aboard bootcamp stuff + whatever I can make use of through work. Codespaces, Copilot, I'm lucky to have great tools at my disposal, I just need to continue to figure out how best to focus so that I don't boil the ocean.

#### Books & Lectures:


#### Specific Tools:
- Codespaces
- GitHub
- Coderunner VS code extension

#### What did I do today?
- set up a new repo and codespace from scratch
- add the coderunner VS code extension
- "hello world" in ruby using puts
- booleans
- integers
- strings
- arrays
- hashes
- manipulations of the above
- positions

It was a bit of a challenge to put it all together, especially as my mind wanted to use the minimum tools necessary. But to properly answer the 2 exercises, I had to use everything that was taught in the session. Nice.
